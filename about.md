# The face beyond the screen


Hello, Iâ€™m Fadi, a software developer. I live in Brussels. I fell in love of computer science when I saw a blue screen of death for the first time :grin:.

I'm actually working for Bisnode Belgium. I'm specialized in web application. I think that we all have something to learn from each others. I hope you will find something interesting.
