We are constantly looking for a way to enhance the user experience. One way to improve the UX is to rely on animation.

But we have to trigger the animation when the element is visible on screen otherwise, we lose all the interest of using animations !

To do so I created a dead simple library called react-on-screen.

Check the demo [here](https://sniphpet.github.io/react-on-screen/demo-react-on-screen.html).

You can find the doc and all the details [here](https://sniphpet.github.io/react-on-screen).
